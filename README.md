# Map Me - Flutterized
:earth_americas: This project is a Flutterized version of the [Map Me] project. Track your walking route and see the distance and time. The goal of the project is to practice recreating UI elements and getting familiar with the [google_maps_flutter] package. (No data gets saved!)

## How to Build üì±

Note that you will need to make a new project in the **Google Cloud Platform**, and enable the **Google Maps API** for that project. Then you need to copy the API Key and it to the code in multiple locations: 

- Add the key to this file `lib/util/constants.dart`:
  ```dart
    static const String APIKEY = "<-- YOUR API KEY -->";
  ```
 
- Next go to the Android manifest file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add your API key here:
  ```xml
  <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
  ```


## Release

Because of the Google Maps API Key, there could be a cost for me depending on how many users use the app.
So I'll keep the APK in releases for a limited time: [releases]
