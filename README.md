# Map Me - Flutterized
:earth_americas: This project is a Flutterized version of the [Map Me] project. Tracks your location and see details of the route: speed, elapsed time and distance covered. The goal of the project is to practice recreating the UI elements of [this] image and getting familiar with the [google_maps_flutter] package. (No data gets saved!)

## Download
Because of the *Google Maps API Key*, it could cost me if there are a lot of users the app. So for the meantime, I'll keep the APK in [Releases] and might remove it after some time.


## Features ‚úîÔ∏è
* Detect the current location of the user
* Draw the route between start location and current location using Polylines
* Calculate the actual distance of the route
* Stopwatch to time the walk

## Comments
The architecture can be improved. Since it's only possible to get the `dart GoogleMapsController` from the widget itself, I wasn't able to keep all logic-code inside the BLoC. I need to research a better solution to separate the UI and business logic. However the ultimate goal of practising with the UI elements and the google_maps_flutter package has been achieved! üòé

Also, this app works on both Android & IOS. However, the IOS version hasn't been fully tested for functionality.


## How to Build üì±
Note that you need to make a new project in the **Google Cloud Platform**, and enable the **Google Maps API** for that project. Then you need to copy the API Key and add it to the code in multiple locations: 

- Add the key to this file `lib/util/constants.dart`:
  ```dart
    static const String APIKEY = "<-- YOUR API KEY -->";
  ```
 
- Next go to the Android manifest file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add your API key here:
  ```xml
  <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
  ```

- Lastly, go to the file `Runner/AppDelegate.swift` and add your API key there as well:
  ```swift
    GMSServices.provideAPIKey("<-- YOUR API KEY -->")
  ```
